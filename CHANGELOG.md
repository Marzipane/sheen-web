# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release: sheen for the web, from Flutter sheen 0.3.6.

- Tokens (`tokens/tokens.json`) as CSS custom properties `--sheen-*` for light and dark, following the system or
  `data-theme`; the same colours, spacing and radii as Flutter sheen, checked against it in CI.
- Glass: `.sheen-glass`, `.sheen-glass-clear`, `.sheen-glass-prominent`, with opaque fallbacks for reduced
  transparency, high contrast and browsers without `backdrop-filter`.
- Blade components (`<x-sheen::…>`): icon, glass, button, icon-button, chip, deal-badge, was-price, deal-line, score,
  stars, photo, hotel-card, trip-card, trip-tag, choices, choice, itinerary, key-value, list-row, action-bar, field,
  stepper, check, pill, steps, alert, tabs, photo-viewer.
- `dist/sheen.js`: the photo viewer (chips, arrows, swipe, Esc) and the stepper; no dependencies.
- The Flutter sheen glyphs, generated into `resources/icons.php`.
